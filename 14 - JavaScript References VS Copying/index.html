		// start with strings, numbers and booleans
		// let str1 = "Rohit";
		// let str2 = str1;
		// console.log({ str1, str2 });
		// str2 = "hitro";
		// console.log({ str1, str2 });

		// Let's say we have an array
		let players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
		// let superPlayers = players;
		// console.log({players, superPlayers});
		// superPlayers[2] = "Rohit";
		// console.log({players, superPlayers});

		// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

		// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

		// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

		// one way

		// or create a new array and concat the old one in
		// let superPlayers = [].concat(players);
		// superPlayers[2] = "Rohit";
		// console.log({players, superPlayers});

		// or use the new ES6 Spread
		// let superPlayers = [...players];
		// superPlayers[2] = "Rohit";
		// console.log({ players, superPlayers });

		// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

		// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

		// with Objects
		const person = {
			name: 'Wes Bos',
			age: 80
		};

		// and think we make a copy:
		// const second = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99 });
		// console.log(person);
		// console.log(second);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
		// Another way is to use Object.stringify first and Object.parse on it to create a copy.
